  Q_05:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient to provide
      either an interval of time or a specific date for how long their symptoms 
      last when the patient experiences them. Format your answer by extracting 
      either an interval of time or a specific date according to the instructions below.
      
      
      Interval of time:
      
      1. For the interval of time, extract a numerical quantity and a unit of 
      time (choose from: minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years).
      For example, "1 month" or "3 years".
      
      2. Convert numbers from text to digits. For example, convert the snippet
      "three days" to "3 days".
      
      3. Imprecise descriptions should be approximated as the nearest common 
      sense numerical value. For example, convert the snippet "about a month" to 
      "1 month". For example, convert the snippet "a couple days" to "2 days". 
      For example, convert the snippet "a few weeks" to "3 weeks". For example, 
      convert the snippet "several years" to "3 years".
      
      
      Specific date:
      
      1. For a specific date, extract and convert the date into a YEAR-MONTH-DAY
      numerical ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, convert the snippet
      "May 2nd 2018" to the ISO format "2018-05-02".
      
      2. For any specific date that mentions only the month but not a specific year,
      extract the string name of the month. For example, convert the snippet
      "this past Feb" to "February".
      
      3. For any specific date that mentions only the year but not a specific month,
      extract the numerical value of the year. For example, convert the snippet
      "it happened in 2019" to "2019".
      
      4. For any specific date that mentions both a month and a year but not a
      specific day of the month, assume it is the 15th day of the month *unless*
      the patient gives an approximate day (such as "beginning" which you should
      approximate as "1"; or "end" which you should approximate as "28"). Extract
      a numerical date in the ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD. For example, convert the
      snippet "March 2020" to "2020-03-15". For example, convert the snippet
      "beginning of July 2019" as "2019-07-01". For example, convert the snippet
      "end of October 2018" to "2018-10-28".
      
      5. These interviews were recorded on {reference_date}. As such, any
      mention of "last year" should be interpreted relative to {reference_date}.
      For example, "August of last year" would be the most recent August before
      {reference_date}.
      
      6. Keep in mind that some dates may be written as text instead of numbers.
      In these cases, convert the text into a numerical date format using the rules
      above. For example, convert the snippet "September first twenty eighteen"
      to "2018-09-01".
      
      
      Additional instructions:
      
      It is possible that the patient talks about something other than an interval
      of time or a specific date. In this case, your answer should be a single
      word: "IRRELEVANT".
      
      
      Answer with either an interval of time or a specific date according to the
      format instructions above. Or answer with "IRRELEVANT" is no interval of
      time or specific date is mentioned. Do not output anything else.

      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient when they first 
      noticed their current symptoms. Format your answer by extracting either an
      interval of time or a specific date according to the instructions below.
      
      
      Interval of time:
      
      1. For the interval of time, extract a numerical quantity and a unit of 
      time (choose from: minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years).
      For example, "1 month" or "3 years".

      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient whether they 
      have noticed a pattern that makes their symptoms worse. For this task, 
      focus on mentions of the *time of day*. For each patient, your task is to 
      extract and categorize the most appropriate time of day answer from the
      following options.


      Options:

      1. Does the patient mention a specific time of day?

      For each mention of a specific time of day, answer with "YES: <when>".
      Fill in "<when>" with the specific time of day mentioned. For example, 
      convert the snippet "oh, yes, in the evening" to "YES: evening".

      
      If the patient mentions multiple specific times of day, list each one on 
      *a separate line*. For example, convert the snippet 
      "in the afternoon and also overnight" to:
      
      "YES: evening
      
      YES: overnight"


      2. No specific time of day.

      If the patient does not mention any specific time of day, answer with 
      "NO". For example, convert the snippet "no, there is no pattern" to "NO".

      
      NOTE: Some patients may answer by giving a non-specific time, such as 
      "all the time" or "no special time". Since these are not specific, answer 
      with "NO". For example, convert the snippet "all the time" to "NO".

      
      NOTE: Some patients may give an answer that has nothing to do with the 
      time of day, such as "on exertion". For all of these, since no specific 
      time of day is mentioned, answer with "NO". For example, convert the 
      snippet "yes, on exertion, yes" to "NO" since exertion is not a time of day.


      Additional instructions:
      
      Answer with the most appropriate of the options listed above. Remember that the
      "YES: <when>" option is repeatable (once per line), but the "NO" option is not
      and should only appear once (if appropriate). Do not output anything else.

      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient whether they 
      have noticed a pattern that makes their symptoms worse. For this task, 
      focus on mentions of patterns *on exertion*. For each patient, your task 
      is to extract and categorize the most appropriate "on exertion" answer 
      from the following options.


      Options:

      1. Does the patient mention "on exertion" or give a specific example of an activity?

      If the patient talks about "on exertion" in the affirmative, answer with "YES". 
      Similarly, if the patient mentions a specific activity, answer with "YES". For 
      example, convert the snippet "definitely exertion" to "YES". Similarly, convert 
      the snippet "when walking" to "YES".

      2. No mention of "on exertion" or of any specific activity.

      If the patient does not talk about "on exertion" in the affirmative, or actively 
      talks about "on exertion" in the negative, or does not mention any specific 
      activity, answer with "NO". For example, convert the snippet 
      "no, not on exertion" to "NO".

      NOTE: Some patients may give an answer that has nothing to do with exertion, 
      such as mentioning a time of day. For all of these, since no explicit exertion 
      mentioned, answer with "NO". For example, convert the snippet "yes, in the 
      afternoon, yes" to "NO" since a time of day has nothing to do with exertion.

      your task is to extract and categorize the most appropriate answer from 
      the following options.


      Options:

      1. Does the patient mention any specific pattern whatsoever?

      Answer "YES: <pattern>" if the patient mentions at least one specific 
      pattern they have observed, whether that pattern is a time of day, on 
      exertion, or something else. For each mention of a pattern, extract the 
      pattern to fill in the "<pattern>" following "YES: <pattern>". For example, 
      convert the snippet "oh, yes, in the evening" to "YES: evening".

      
      If the patient mentions multiple specific patterns, list each one on *a 
      separate line*. For example, convert the snippet "in the afternoon and 
      also overnight" to:

      "YES: evening

      YES: overnight"

      
      NOTE: Some patients may say "all the time" or "no special time". That is 
      not a specific pattern. The patient is saying they feel bad all the time. 
      So, do *not* answer "YES" in this case. Instead, answer "NO" from the case below.

      
      2. The patient mentions that there is no pattern or no specific pattern.

      If the patient talks about a lack of pattern, answer with "NO". For example, 
      convert the snippet "no, no pattern" to "NO".

      
      NOTE: Some patients may say "all the time" or "no special time". That is not 
      a specific pattern. The patient is saying they feel bad all the time. So, 
      you should answer "NO" in this case. For example, convert the snippet "yes, 
      I feel bad all the time" to "NO" because all the time is not a specific pattern.

      
      3. The patient talks about something else.

      Some patients may ignore the interviewer's question and talk about something 
      other than patterns related to their symptoms. In these cases, answer with 
      "IRRELEVANT". For example, convert the snippet "I feel better now" to 
      "IRRELEVANT" since feeling better now is a current state and is irrelevant 
      to the discussion of past patterns.


      Additional instructions:
      
      Answer with the most appropriate of the options listed above. Remember that
      the "YES: <pattern>" option is repeatable (once per line), but the "NO" and 
      "IRRELEVANT" options are not and should only appear once (when the case is
      appropriate). Do not output anything else.

  Q_10:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient to provide either
      an interval of time or a specific date for how long they experienced their
      symptoms before they sought medical attention. Format your answer by extracting 
      either an interval of time or a specific date according to the instructions below.
      
      
      Interval of time:
      
      1. For the interval of time, extract a numerical quantity and a unit of 
      time (choose from: minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years).
      For example, "1 month" or "3 years".
      
      2. Convert numbers from text to digits. For example, convert the snippet
      "three days" to "3 days".
      
      3. Imprecise descriptions should be approximated as the nearest common 
      sense numerical value. For example, convert the snippet "about a month" to 
      "1 month". For example, convert the snippet "a couple days" to "2 days". 
      For example, convert the snippet "a few weeks" to "3 weeks". For example, 
      convert the snippet "several years" to "3 years".
      
      4. If the patient expresses some immediate timeframe or state, convert these
      to "0 minutes". For example, convert the snippet "I came right away" or
      "I didn't wait" to "0 minutes".
      
      
      Specific date:
      
      1. For a specific date, extract and convert the date into a YEAR-MONTH-DAY
      numerical ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, convert the snippet
      "May 2nd 2018" to the ISO format "2018-05-02".
      
      2. For any specific date that mentions only the month but not a specific year,
      extract the string name of the month. For example, convert the snippet
      "this past Feb" to "February".
      
      3. For any specific date that mentions only the year but not a specific month,
      extract the numerical value of the year. For example, convert the snippet
      "it happened in 2019" to "2019".
      
      4. For any specific date that mentions both a month and a year but not a
      specific day of the month, assume it is the 15th day of the month *unless*
      the patient gives an approximate day (such as "beginning" which you should
      approximate as "1"; or "end" which you should approximate as "28"). Extract
      a numerical date in the ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD. For example, convert the
      snippet "March 2020" to "2020-03-15". For example, convert the snippet
      "beginning of July 2019" as "2019-07-01". For example, convert the snippet
      "end of October 2018" to "2018-10-28".
      
      5. These interviews were recorded on {reference_date}. As such, any
      mention of "last year" should be interpreted relative to {reference_date}.
      For example, "August of last year" would be the most recent August before
      {reference_date}.
      
      6. Keep in mind that some dates may be written as text instead of numbers.
      In these cases, convert the text into a numerical date format using the rules
      above. For example, convert the snippet "September first twenty eighteen"
      to "2018-09-01".
      
      
      Additional instructions:
      
      It is possible that the patient talks about something other than an interval
      of time or a specific date. In this case, your answer should be a single
      word: "IRRELEVANT".
      
      
      Answer with either an interval of time or a specific date according to the
      format instructions above. Or answer with "IRRELEVANT" is no interval of
      time or specific date is mentioned. Do not output anything else.

  Q_10a:
    prompt: >-      
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient why they did not seek
      medical attention sooner for their heart failure. For each patient, your task 
      is to convert the patient's response into or or more of the following options
      based on the most appropriate case.


      Options:

      1. "DISMISSIVE/DENIAL"

      Answer "DISMISSIVE/DENIAL" if the patient's response suggests the patient was
      either dismissive of their symptoms or in denial that they have a problem. For
      example, convert the snippet "I thought it would go away" to "DISMISSIVE/DENIAL".
      For example, convert the snippet "I never expected to have heart failure" to
      "DISMISSIVE/DENIAL".


      2. "AFRAID"

      Answer "AFRAID" if the patient's response suggests was afraid to seek medical
      attention.


      3. "OTHER: <reason>"

      Answer "OTHER: <reason>" if the patient mentions some other reason for not
      seeking medical attention sooner that does not fit in neatly with the above
      options. Fill in the "<reason>" with a short (5-10 word) descriptive summary
      of the reason the patient gives. If the patient gives more than one reason,
      separate each reason with a comma to create a comma-separated list of reasons.


      4. "IRRELEVANT"

      Answer "IRRELEVANT" if the patient talks about something other than the
      reason they did not seek medical attention sooner.


      Additional instructions:

      Answer with any of the options listed above that are appropriate. If more than
      one option is appropriate at the same time, list each appropriate option on
      a new line. For example, convert the snippet "I was in denial and also afraid
      to come to the hospital" to
      
      "DISMISSIVE/DENIAL
      
      AFRAID"
      
      
      CAUTION: Even though multiple options can be appropriate at the same time,
      each individual option should only appear once (when the case is appropriate).
      Do not output anything else.

  Q_11_11a:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient whether they 
      have been previously hospitalized for the same symptoms they are currently
      experiencing. For each patient, your task is to extract and categorize the 
      most appropriate answer from the following options.


      Options:

      1. "NEVER"

      Answer with "NEVER" if the patient expresses that they have never been 
      previously hospitalized for their current symptoms.


      2. "30 DAYS"

      Answer with "30 DAYS" if the patient expresses that they have been previously 
      hospitalized for their current symptoms specifically within the last 30 days.

      
      3. "6 MONTHS"
      
      Answer with "6 MONTHS" if the patient expresses that they have been previously
      hospitalized for their current symptoms specifically within the last 6 months.

      
      4. "1 YEAR"
      
      Answer with "1 YEAR" if the patient expresses that they have been previously 
      hospitalized for their current symptoms specifically within the last year. 
      Keep in mind that some patients will express a specific month instead of 
      mentioning a year. In this case, they mean the most recent occurrence of 
      that month, so it must be within a year. For example, convert the snippet 
      "last November" to "1 YEAR" because the patient is clearly intending to 
      mean the most recent past November (the one that happened within 1 year).
      
      
      5. "5 YEARS"

      Answer with "5 YEARS" if the patient expresses that they have been previously 
      hospitalized for their current symptoms specifically within the last 5 years. 
      Keep in mind that the interview is taking place on {reference_date}. As
      such, any  mention of a specific year should be calculated relative to
      {reference_date}. For example, convert the snippet "yeah, in 2017" to the
      answer "5 YEARS" because the gap between 2017-01-01 and {reference_date}
      is less than 5 years.

      
      6. "YES, BUT NO TIME GIVEN"

      Answer with "YES, BUT NO TIME GIVEN" if the patient expresses that they have 
      been previously hospitalized for their current symptoms, but without 
      elaborating as to how long ago it was.

      
      7. "YES, BUT FOR OTHER SYMPTOMS"

      Answer with "YES, BUT FOR OTHER SYMPTOMS" if the patient expresses that they 
      have been previously hospitalized, but not for their current symptoms.
      
      
      8. "IRRELEVANT"
      
      Answer with "IRRELEVANT" if the patient fails to answer the interviewer's 
      question because they are talking about something other than their previous 
      hospitalization.

      Options:

      1. "BETTER"

      Answer with "BETTER" if the patient expresses that they feel better now 
      than before.


      2. "SAME"

      Answer with "SAME" if the patient expresses that they feel about the same 
      now as before.

      
      3. "WORSE"
      
      Answer with "WORSE" if the patient expresses that they feel worse now than before.

      
      4. "IRRELEVANT"
      
      Answer with "IRRELEVANT" if the patient fails to answer the interviewer's

  Q_12:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient to give a 
      number on a scale of 1 to 10 to describe their general state of health. For 
      each patient, your task is to extract a numerical value from their answer.

      
      Sometimes the numerical value will be spelled out, like "three". In these
      cases, convert the value to the equivalent number. For example, convert 
      "three" to "3".
      
      Interpret the patient saying something along the lines of "not good" or "very 
      bad" as a score of "1". Interpret the patient saying something along the lines 
      of "somewhat" or "middle amount" as a score of "5". Interpret the patient saying
      something along the lines of "very good" or "best" or as a score of "10".

      
      If the patient fails to give a numerical response, answer with "IRRELEVANT".
      
      
      If the patient is undecided between two values, answer with the in between score
      with ".5" added. For example, convert the snippet "7 or 8" to "7.5".

      
      To summarize, your answer should be either the single word "IRRELEVANT" or
      a number between 1 and 10. Do not output anything else.

  Q_13:
    prompt: >-      
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient where they seek
      medical attention. For each patient, your task is to convert the patient's
      response into or or more of the following options based on the most
      appropriate case.
      
      
      NOTE: Your task is to extract the patient's response *for this admission*. For
      example, a patient might say "I usually go to my doctor, but this time I came
      here to the Toronto General Hospital". In this case, your answer should be
      "HOSPITAL: Toronto General" (as per the options below), because that is where
      the patient went for this admission (even if they normally go to their doctor).


      Options:

      1. "HOSPITAL: <name_of_hospital>"

      Answer "HOSPITAL: <name_of_hospital>" if the patient mentions seeking medical
      attention at a hospital. Fill in "<name_of_hospital>" with the name of the
      hospital that the patient mentions.
      
      
      NOTE: Typically if a patient mentions a place name without any additional 
      context, they are referring to the hospital in that place. For example, the
      a patient response of "Toronto General" means "Toronto General Hospital" so
      you should answer "HOSPITAL: Toronto General".
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions "this" hospital, fill in "<name_of_hospital>"
      with the special tag "THIS". For example, convert the snippet "I came to
      this hospital" to "HOSPITAL: THIS".
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions coming to hospital but fails to give a 
      specific name, fill in "<name_of_hospital>" with the special tag "UNKNOWN".
      For example, convert the snippet "I came to the hospital" to "HOSPITAL: UNKNOWN".

      
      2. "DOCTOR: <specialty>"

      Answer "DOCTOR: <specialty>" if the patient mentions going to a doctor to seek
      medical attention for this admission. Fill in "<specialty>" with the name of the
      doctor's specialty if mentioned. These can include, but are not limited to:
      
      - family
      
      - cardiologist
      
      - heart surgeon
      
      etc.
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions going to see a doctor but fails to give a 
      specific speciality, fill in "<specialty>" with the special tag "UNKNOWN".
      For example, convert the snippet "I went to see my doctor" to "DOCTOR: UNKNOWN".


      3. "DEPARTMENT: <which>"

      Answer "DEPARTMENT: <which>" if the patient mentions a specific department
      where they sought medical attention. Fill in "<which>" with the name of the
      department that the patient mentions. For example, convert the snippet
      "I went to the emergency" to "DEPARTMENT: emergency". You should also
      consider any mention of clinics are a department. For example, convert the
      snippet "I went to my clinic" to DEPARTMENT: clinic".


      4. "OTHER"
      
      Answer "OTHER" for any specific mention of a place where the patient went
      to seek medical attention for this admission that does not fit in the
      categories of "HOSPITAL", "DOCTOR", or "DEPARTMENT".
      
      
      5. "IRRELEVANT"

      Answer "IRRELEVANT" if the patient talks about something other than the
      where they went to seek medical attention for this admission.


      Additional instructions:

      Answer with any of the options listed above that are appropriate. If more than
      one option is appropriate at the same time, list each appropriate option on
      a new line. For example, convert the snippet "I went to Toronto General, 
      specifically the emergency department" to
      
      "HOSPITAL: Toronto General
      
      DEPARTMENT: emergency"
      
      
      NOTE: "HOSPITAL: <name_of_hospital>", "DOCTOR: <specialty>", and
      "DEPARTMENT: <which>" can appear multiple times for each unique
      "<name_of_hospital>", "<specialty>", and "<which>", respectively. Each
      new occurrence should appear on a newline.
      
      
      NOTE: "OTHER" and "IRRELEVANT" should only appear once (when the case is
      appropriate).
      
      
      Answer according to the format specification described above.

  Q_19c:
    prompt: >-      
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient whether or not
      they feel better, the same, or worse since starting their medication. For
      each patient, your task is to convert the patient's response into or or more
      of the following options based on the most appropriate case.


      Options:

      1. "BETTER: <medication or purpose>"

      For each specific medication that the patient mentions makes them feel better,
      answer with "BETTER: <medication or purpose>". Fill "<medication or purpose>"
      with the name of the medication or the stated purpose of the medication. For
      example, convert "Lasix makes me feel better" to "BETTER: Lasix" since Lasix
      is the name of a medication. For example, convert "the one for the heart
      makes me feel better" to "BETTER: heart".
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions feeling better but without specifying which
      medication, fill in "<medication or purpose>" with the special tag
      "UNSPECIFIED". For example, convert the snippet "Yes, it makes me feel
      better" to "BETTER: UNSPECIFIED", since the patient fails to specify which
      specific medication makes them feel better.
      
      
      2. "SAME: <medication or purpose>"

      For each specific medication that the patient mentions makes them feel the same,
      answer with "SAME: <medication or purpose>". Fill "<medication or purpose>"
      with the name of the medication or the stated purpose of the medication. For
      example, convert "Lasix makes me feel the same" to "SAME: Lasix" since Lasix
      is the name of a medication. For example, convert "the one for the heart
      makes me feel the same" to "SAME: heart".


      NOTE: If the patient mentions feeling the same but without specifying which
      medication, fill in "<medication or purpose>" with the special tag
      "UNSPECIFIED". For example, convert the snippet "It makes me feel the same"
      to "SAME: UNSPECIFIED", since the patient fails to specify which
      specific medication makes them feel the same.


      3. "WORSE: <medication or purpose>"

      For each specific medication that the patient mentions makes them feel worse,
      answer with "WORSE: <medication or purpose>". Fill "<medication or purpose>"
      with the name of the medication or the stated purpose of the medication. For
      example, convert "Lasix makes me feel worse" to "WORSE: Lasix" since Lasix
      is the name of a medication. For example, convert "the one for the heart
      makes me feel worse" to "WORSE: heart".


      NOTE: If the patient mentions feeling worse but without specifying which
      medication, fill in "<medication or purpose>" with the special tag
      "UNSPECIFIED". For example, convert the snippet "It makes me feel worse"
      to "WORSE: UNSPECIFIED", since the patient fails to specify which
      specific medication makes them feel worse.


      4. "UNSURE: <medication or purpose>"

      For each specific medication that the patient mentions where they are unsure
      whether it makes them feel better, the same, or worse, answer with "UNSURE:
      <medication or purpose>". Fill "<medication or purpose>" with the name of
      the medication or the stated purpose of the medication. For example, convert
      "I don't know if Lasix is helping" to "UNSURE: Lasix" since Lasix
      is the name of a medication. For example, convert "the one for the heart
      I don't know if it's helping" to "UNSURE: heart".


      NOTE: If the patient mentions they are unsure but without specifying which
      medication they are unsure about, fill in "<medication or purpose>" with
      the special tag "UNSPECIFIED". For example, convert the snippet "I'm not
      sure if it's helping" to "UNSURE: UNSPECIFIED", since the patient fails to
      specify which specific medication they are unsure about.
      
      
      5. "IRRELEVANT"

      Answer with "IRRELEVANT" if the patient fails to answer the interviewer's 
      question because they are talking about something other than whether or not
      their medication is making them feel better, the same or, worse.


      Additional instructions:

      Answer with any of the options listed above that are appropriate. If more than
      one option is appropriate at the same time, list each appropriate option on
      a new line. For example, convert the snippet "The Lasix is helping, but the
      other I'm not sure" to
      
      "BETTER: Lasix
      
      UNSURE: UNSPECIFIED"
      
      
      NOTE: "IRRELEVANT" should only appear once (when the case is appropriate).

  Q_22:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient whether they 
      worry about their health and, if so, what their biggest worry is. For each 
      patient, your task is to determine if the patient is worried and, if so, 
      what that worry is. Extract the categorize the most appropriate answer from 
      the following options. 
      
      
      Options:

      1. "YES: <worry>"

      Answer "YES: <worry>" if the patient mentions that they do worry about their
      health. Fill in "<worry>" a description of their biggest worry.
      
      
      Some common worries are:

      - body system (e.g., heart, kidneys, etc.)

      - family

      - function

      
      If the patient mentions any of these directly, use the corresponding key term as 
      your summary of the patient's response. For example, convert the snippet "I want 
      to go back to functioning normally" to "YES: function". For example, convert the 
      snippet "I'm worried about my kidneys" to "YES: kidneys". If the patient mentions 
      some other biggest worry, summarize that worry into a 1-3 word description.
      
      
      If patient mentions more than one worry, group these individual worries into
      a comma-separated list of worries. For example, convert the snippet "I'm 
      worried about my heart and my kidneys" to "YES: heart, kidneys".
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions being worried but without specifying a clear
      worry, fill in "<worry>" with the special tag "UNSPECIFIED". For example,
      convert the snippet "Yes, I'm worried" to "YES: UNSPECIFIED", since the
      patient fails to specify which specific worry they have.

      
      2. "SOMEWHAT: <worry>"

      Answer "SOMEWHAT: <worry>" if the patient mentions that they are only somewhat
      worried about their health. This can include expressions such as "sure" or
      "I guess so". Fill in "<worry>" a description of their biggest worry.
      
      
      Some common worries are:

      - body system (e.g., heart, kidneys, etc.)

      - family

      - function

      
      If the patient mentions any of these directly, use the corresponding key term as 
      your summary of the patient's response. For example, convert the snippet "I'm a 
      little bit worried about my kidneys" to "SOMEWHAT: kidneys". If the patient
      mentions some other biggest worry, summarize it into a 1-3 word description.
      
      
      If patient mentions more than one worry, group these individual worries into
      a comma-separated list of worries. For example, convert the snippet "I'm a little
      bit worried about my heart and my kidneys" to "SOMEWHAT: heart, kidneys".
      
      
      NOTE: If the patient mentions being worried but without specifying a clear
      worry, fill in "<worry>" with the special tag "UNSPECIFIED". For example,
      convert the snippet "I'm a little worried" to "SOMEWHAT: UNSPECIFIED",
      since the patient fails to specify which specific worry they have.


      3. "NO"

      Answer with "NO" if the patient expresses that they do *not* worry about
      their health.


      4. "IRRELEVANT"

  Q_24a:
    prompt: >-
      In the snippet below, the interviewer is asking each patient to provide
      either an interval of time or a specific date for how long they have been
      in Canada. Format your answer by extracting either an interval of time or
      a specific date according to the instructions below.
      
      
      Interval of time:
      
      1. For the interval of time, extract a numerical quantity and a unit of 
      time (choose from: minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years).
      For example, "1 month" or "3 years".
      
      2. Convert numbers from text to digits. For example, convert the snippet
      "three days" to "3 days".
      
      3. Imprecise descriptions should be approximated as the nearest common 
      sense numerical value. For example, convert the snippet "about a month" to 
      "1 month". For example, convert the snippet "a couple days" to "2 days". 
      For example, convert the snippet "a few weeks" to "3 weeks". For example, 
      convert the snippet "several years" to "3 years".
      
      
      Specific date:
      
      1. For a specific date, extract and convert the date into a YEAR-MONTH-DAY
      numerical ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, convert the snippet
      "May 2nd 2018" to the ISO format "2018-05-02".
      
      2. For any specific date that mentions only the month but not a specific year,
      extract the string name of the month. For example, convert the snippet
      "this past Feb" to "February".
      
      3. For any specific date that mentions only the year but not a specific month,
      extract the numerical value of the year. For example, convert the snippet
      "it happened in 2019" to "2019".
      
      4. For any specific date that mentions both a month and a year but not a
      specific day of the month, assume it is the 15th day of the month *unless*
      the patient gives an approximate day (such as "beginning" which you should
      approximate as "1"; or "end" which you should approximate as "28"). Extract
      a numerical date in the ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD. For example, convert the
      snippet "March 2020" to "2020-03-15". For example, convert the snippet
      "beginning of July 2019" as "2019-07-01". For example, convert the snippet
      "end of October 2018" to "2018-10-28".
      
      5. These interviews were recorded on {reference_date}. As such, any
      mention of "last year" should be interpreted relative to {reference_date}.
      For example, "August of last year" would be the most recent August before
      {reference_date}.
      
      6. Keep in mind that some dates may be written as text instead of numbers.
      In these cases, convert the text into a numerical date format using the rules
      above. For example, convert the snippet "September first twenty eighteen"
      to "2018-09-01".
      
      
      Additional instructions:
      
      It is possible that the patient talks about something other than an interval
      of time or a specific date. In this case, your answer should be a single
      word: "IRRELEVANT". You should also answer with "IRRELEVANT" if the patient
      doesn't give a specific interval of time or data. For example, convert the
      snippet "a long time" to "IRRELEVANT". For example, convert the snippet "I
      don't remember" to "IRRELEVANT".
      
      
      Answer with either an interval of time or a specific date according to the
      format instructions above. Or answer with "IRRELEVANT" is no interval of
      time or specific date is mentioned. Do not output anything else.

      For each patient, your task is to extract a numerical value from their answer.

      
      Sometimes the numerical value will be spelled out, like "three". In these
      cases, convert the value to the equivalent number. For example, convert 
      "three" to "3".
      
      
      Interpret the patient saying something along the lines of "not good" or "very 
      bad" as a score of "0". Interpret the patient saying something along the lines 
      of "somewhat" or "middle amount" as a score of "5". Interpret the patient saying
      something along the lines of "very good" or "best" or as a score of "10".

      
      If the patient fails to give a numerical response, answer with "IRRELEVANT".
      
      
      If the patient is undecided between two values, answer with the in between score
      with ".5" added. For example, convert the snippet "7 or 8" to "7.5".

      
      To summarize, your answer should be either the single word "IRRELEVANT" or
      a number between 0 and 10. Do not output anything else.
